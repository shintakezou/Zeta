Zeta, experimental chess engine written in OpenCL.

You will need an config.ini file to run the engine,
start engine from command line with --guessconfig option,
to create config files for all OpenCL devices.

Options:
 -l, --log          Write output/debug to file zeta.log
 -v, --version      Print Zeta version info.
 -h, --help         Print Zeta program usage help.
 -s, --selftest     Run an internal test, usefull after compile.
 --guessconfig      Guess minimal config for all OpenCL devices
 --guessconfigx     Guess optimal config for all OpenCL devices

To play against the engine use an CECP v2 protocol capable chess GUI
like Arena, Cutechess, Winboard or Xboard.

Alternatively you can use Xboard commmands directly on commmand Line,
e.g.:
new            // init new game from start position
level 40 4 0   // set time control to 40 moves in 4 minutes
go             // let engine play site to move
usermove d7d5  // let engine apply usermove in coordinate algebraic
               // notation and optionally start thinking

The implemented Time Control is a bit shacky, tuned for 40 moves in 4 minutes.

Not supported Xboard commands:
analyze        // enter analyze mode
?              // move now
draw           // handle draw offers
hard/easy      // turn on/off pondering
hint           // give user a hint move
bk             // book Lines

Non-Xboard commands:
selftest       // run an internal test
help           // print usage info
log            // turn log on

WARNING:
It is recommended to run the engine on an discrete GPU,
without display connected,
otherwise system and display can freeze during computation.

Windows OS have an internal gpu timeout, double click the .reg file 
"SetWindowsGPUTimeoutTo20s.reg"
and reboot the OS to set the timeout to 20 seconds.
