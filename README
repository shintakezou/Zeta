Zeta, experimental chess engine written in OpenCL.

Tested Platforms:
64 bit x86-64 with little endian OpenCL devices on
Windows 7 64 bit and GNU/Linux 64 bit OS

Usage:
First make sure you have an working OpenCL Runtime Environment,
start the zeta executable in command line with -dl option to list
all available OpenCL devices on host

Second check the OpenCL device and create a config.ini file for the engine,
zeta -p 0 -d 0 --guessconfigx
Where p is the selected platform id and d is the selected device id.

Third rename the created config file to config.ini and start the engine.


All Options:
 -l, --log          Write output/debug to file zeta.log
 -v, --version      Print Zeta version info.
 -h, --help         Print Zeta program usage help.
 -s, --selftest     Run an internal test, usefull after compile.
 -pl,               List all OpenCL Platforms on Host
 -dl,               List all OpenCL Devices on Host
 -p 0,              Set Platform ID to 0 for guessconfig 
 -d 0,              Set Device ID to 0 for guessconfig 
 --guessconfig      Guess minimal config for OpenCL devices
 --guessconfigx     Guess optimal config for OpenCL devices


To play against the engine use an CECP v2 protocol capable chess GUI
like Arena, Cutechess, Winboard or Xboard.

Alternatively you can use Xboard commmands directly on commmand Line,
e.g.:
new            // init new game from start position
level 40 4 0   // set time control to 40 moves in 4 minutes
go             // let engine play site to move
usermove d7d5  // let engine apply usermove in coordinate algebraic
               // notation and optionally start thinking

The implemented Time Control is a bit shacky, tuned for 40 moves in 4 minutes


Not supported Xboard commands:
analyze        // enter analyze mode
?              // move now
draw           // handle draw offers
hard/easy      // turn on/off pondering
hint           // give user a hint move
bk             // book lines

Non-Xboard commands:
perft          // perform a performance test, depth set by sd command
selftest       // run an internal test
help           // print usage info
log            // turn log on


WARNING:
It is recommended to run the engine on an discrete GPU,
without display connected,
otherwise system and display can freeze or crash during computation.

Some GPU drivers have an timeout of 5 seconds if GPU is connected to display.
So make sure to use an discrete GPU or set proper time controls.

Windows OS have an internal gpu timeout, double click the .reg file 
"SetWindowsGPUTimeoutTo20s.reg"
and reboot the OS to set the timeout to 20 seconds.
